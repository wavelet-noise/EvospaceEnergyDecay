Mod example

The Energy Decay Mod adds a dynamic energy dissipation system to all energy-generating entities in the game, enforcing real-time decay of unused energy outputs. 
It applies a continuous loss mechanism to stored energy, simulating realistic entropy for heat, electricity, and other power forms.
